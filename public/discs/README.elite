This elite image is NOT free software. It is a fixed-up version of one posted by Ian Bell
on his http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/bbc/ website.  The original version didn't
work and would give "Bad command" when transitioning between docked and space modes.

Help in finding and fixing this given on a Stairway to Hell link:
